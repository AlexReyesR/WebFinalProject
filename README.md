Final project: WENGLISH. The project consists on a webpage for learning english by improving the vocabulary. It provides the tool of translation by using a spanish/english translator API, the tool of finding definition about the word by using a different API focused on a dictionary purpose, and a tool of show related words, by using a third API.

The interconnection of these three APIs presents a useful and powerful site for english learners.

Users can create and modify topics of words when they are logged in, while everybody, even non-users, can look for the existing topics. All this process is done by the communication of two databases: one for users, and one more for topics.
